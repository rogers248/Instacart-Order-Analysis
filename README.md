This repo shows a set of Jupyter Notebooks that I used to tackle the Instacart Masket Basket Analysis challenge. The dataset for this competition is a relational set of files describing customers' orders over time. The goal of the competition is to predict which products will be in a user's next order. The dataset is anonymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 Instacart users. For each user, Instacart provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purchased in each order. Instacart also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and a relative measure of time between orders.

Here are two different notebooks:

- Data Exploration: Exploring the raw datasets.
- Customer Segmentation: Segmenting the customers with Principal Component Analysis and K-Means Clustering.
